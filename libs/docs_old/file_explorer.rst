File Explorer
=============

The file explorer lists by default all the files stored in your browser. You can see them in the `browser` folder. You can always rename, remove or add new files to the file explorer.

Note that clearing the browser storage will permanently delete all the solidity files you wrote. To avoid this, you can use Remixd, which enables you to store and sync files in the browser with your local computer (for more information see :doc:`../tutorial_remixd_filesystem`)
